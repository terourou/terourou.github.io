**Follow-up Workshop Report**
On Friday, 10 March, we held a focused workshop that built on the input and comments we heard from you during the symposium. This workshop combined your feedback with the experiences of our expert guests and key individuals to the key elements in building a safe, secure, and high performing national data system. We will write a report as a record of this event, and it will be available on our website in the coming weeks.

Thank you again for attending. We hope the symposium has provided you with new information and extended networks that will assist you in shaping the future of this country’s data system.
