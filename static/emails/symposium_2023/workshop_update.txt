**Our Data Sources as a Strategic National Asset**

Aotearoa New Zealand has world-leading public data, so how do we realise the value of these data assets?

**Friday 10 March 2023**
**Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand, Wellington**

Kia ora {$first_name},

Thank you for attending our workshop and helping to make it a success. It has already resulted in follow-up contact from the office of the Minister of Statistics as well as senior leadership in several key agencies.

Most of the speakers’ slides are now available on our website.

We will now begin to compile the notes taken throughout the day and write up a draft report. You will have the opportunity to read through it and provide feedback or comment before this is published. This report is intended to be a reference document for future policy and funding decisions concerning the key elements in building a safe, secure, and high-performing national data system. It will cover topics not yet covered by our current Government Data Strategy and Roadmap and be well ahead of any investment decisions.

**Next Steps**
The purpose of the two events was to generate some creative thinking about the future direction of this country’s data system. We’ve definitely started that process, which we hope will lead to policy and investment decisions. Meanwhile, we will be seeking significant research funding to build working exemplars of what a high-performing data system would look like. The funding proposals are highly likely to include many of the requirements and innovations discussed at the workshop - so don’t be surprised if you hear from us again later this year.

Thank you again for your time, energy, and support.
