The Informatics for Social Services and Wellbeing Programme, Te Rourou TƒÅtaritanga, and the Social Wellbeing Agency present an opportunity to listen and engage with internationally recognised authorities on linked administrative data.

In this symposium on 9 March 2023, we will host ***in-person presentations and discussions with leading experts*** in data infrastructure, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, and privacy to discuss how innovative approaches could realise the value of our national data assets.
