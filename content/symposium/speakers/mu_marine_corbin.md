Associations between IHD and occupations are poorly understood. This whole-population study aimed to identify occupations associated with increased IHD risk in NZ by sex and ethnicity. A cohort of workers was constructed for the whole NZ adult working population using the Statistics NZ IDI. Occupation was obtained from census data and incident IHD was determined using hospitalisation, prescription, and death records from 2013 to 2018. This study confirmed an increased IHD risk for several occupations previously identified as being high risk for IHD and has also identified some potentially new occupational groups. Important sex and ethnic differences were also observed.
