Contagion models for infectious disease can only be as good as the assumptions that they are built on. One common simplifying assumption is that the disease spreads through a well-mixed, homogeneous population (or populations). This has some obvious consequences for modeling the differential impact of disease on different groups. I will introduce an individual level, network based, contagion model, built from a range of data sources, including census data, and will show how it has been used for modelling the spread of CVOID-19 in Aotearoa NZ.
