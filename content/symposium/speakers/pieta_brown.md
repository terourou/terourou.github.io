In support of the response to COVID-19, New Zealand initiated and rapidly delivered a solution for national algorithm management.  During this project, we stood up a national instance of a machine learning platform, developed a governance process tailored to our local context in Aotearoa, deployed 30 models, and went live with a website (www.algorithmhub.co.nz) to support user engagement and interaction. The underlying technology solution has evolved over the last five years through our research partnership focused on the development and delivery of data science in healthcare; it was built in response to the need for tooling to deploy, manage and monitor algorithms safely and effectively in a healthcare context. This talk will share the key lessons learned from our COVID-19 experience and discuss the technology, user engagement and governance processes that made this successful.
