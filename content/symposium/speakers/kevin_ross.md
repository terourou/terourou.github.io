Precision Driven Health is New Zealand's health data science partnership. For the past five years, we have been forming collaborations between New Zealandâ€™s health IT sector, health providers and universities, aimed at improving health outcomes through data science. Our work seeks to personalise health by integrating new data sources, developing predictive models, optimise decision making and empower people with new tools. We will share some lessons learned from over 100 projects, including the challenges of working with personal information and ensuring equity is improved by design.
