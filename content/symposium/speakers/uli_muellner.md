The National Gambling Study (NGS) is the first New Zealand population representative longitudinal study into gambling behaviours and attitudes, health, and lifestyles. To support the dissemination and use of the findings from the study the National Gambling Study Explorer provides easy and user-friendly access for stakeholders to information on gambling participation and epidemiological risk factors.  The Gambling Data Explorer is freely available at https://www.health.govt.nz/publication/national-gambling-study-data-explorer.  This project was delivered for the Ministry of Health in collaboration with AUT. It demonstrates an innovative way to share research findings and data with stakeholders through online dashboards.
