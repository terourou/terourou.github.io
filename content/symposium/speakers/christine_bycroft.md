Stats NZâ€™s Census Transformation programme will release the first iteration of the experimental Administrative Population Census (APC) in August 2021. The APC uses administrative data to construct an annual census file, and will be an opportunity for groups to provide feedback on an early iteration of admin first Census outputs. At this presentation, we will outline:
* the features of the 2021 APC to demonstrate its potential value to the research community;
* how future iterations of the APC will build on the 2021 release .

Please contact Christine Bycroft (Christine.bycroft@stats.govt.nz) or Vinayak Anand-Kumar (Vinayak.anand-kumar@stats.govt.nz) to get more information about the APC.
