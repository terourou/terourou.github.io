Illnesses and deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic have not been evenly distributed across communities. Risk factors for serious disease (including age, ethnicity, & health conditions), and risk factors for infection (including dwelling size, inter-generational living, & type of work) are not independent. In order to capture the interactions between these factors we build on data from linked StatisticsNZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) to construct a network of the ~5million individuals and their interaction contexts, in particular homes, workplaces, and schools. I will highlight our progress so far, and priorities for future refinements.
