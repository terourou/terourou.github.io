The aim of this project is to develop a digital post occupancy evaluation to efficiently capture the self-reported qualitative perspectives of building occupants about the wellbeing performance of residential buildings. By doing so, my intention is to develop an app-based wellbeing assessment and data collection tool that is informed by the Government’s Living Standards Framework. Data collected via the app will ultimately help inform the planning, design and construction of residential buildings that meet the wellbeing needs of New Zealanders.

The app will be developed and trialled in collaboration with Auckland University of Technology, Tether Ltd and Kāinga Ora.
