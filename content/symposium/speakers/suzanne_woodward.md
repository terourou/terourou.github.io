Evaluating policy initiatives is inherently difficult. We can address this by considering how policy decisions inform social pathways across multiple sectors, and how pathway trajectories affect individual wellbeing. Trajectory data and narratives of lived experience that complement large, linked datasets, provide the opportunity to construct models that can accurately predict wellbeing outcomes at scale. Policymakers can use these models to assess the efficacy of policy initiatives, quantifying their contribution to wellbeing. This approach combines ideas and methods from the policy and social sciences, co-design, data science and mathematical modelling to address the wicked problem of policy design.
