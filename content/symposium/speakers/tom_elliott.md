Survey data has a huge importance for many research groups, but many software tools require users to understand the survey design and know how to specify it to the relevent program. iNZight is a graphical user interface for R that lets researchers quickly and efficiently visualise and explore their data. Recent changes to iNZight allow users to forget the design and focus on what matters: exploring their data.
