Comparing population health outcomes for different places, population groups or time periods is complicated by access to data, different population sizes and population age structures. There are robust epidemiological methods for doing these calculations, but they are not always straightforward, especially when depicting the precision estimates in the results. MƒÅtau is a tool that embeds various robust epidemiological methods, population data and imports outcome data to create a point and click way to calculate levels of health outcomes and compare populations. Already in use in Aotearoa and overseas, it is quick, easy to learn and all results in table and graph format.
