Data preparation is a key stage for analytic and research projects. However, as the number of data sources increases so does the complexity of preparation. Without a consistent method for assembling analysis-ready datasets, this process can become time-consuming, expensive, and error prone.

In response to this, we have developed the Dataset Assembly Tool. By standardising and automating the data preparation and dataset assembly stages of analytic projects, the tool helps staff deliver higher quality work faster. The assembly tool is now available for other researchers to use. This presentation with describe the tool and its advantages.
