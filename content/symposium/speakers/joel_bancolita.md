Describing factors affecting individuals’ transitions addresses several policy questions. For instance, differentiating retention and exit rates of groups of the workforce based on geography, demography or intervention may inform decision-makers in formulating more targeted policies that can influence funding and the lives of people. We tried developing a framework analysing the drivers of transition in the IDI and employed transition modelling to answer these questions aimed at replicating this to several aspects of people’s lives, such as labour force, education and health. We also employed classification models to address some of limitations, like imputing occupation.
