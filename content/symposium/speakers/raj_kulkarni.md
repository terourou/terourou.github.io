This piece of work followed the Having a Baby in South Auckland project, which applied the Social Wellbeing Agency’s representative timeline modelling method to produce insights into South Auckland families’ experiences around the birth of a child. As a result of one of these insights, we investigated fluctuations in new fathers’ income around time of the birth and found that a substantial proportion of fathers who usually earn around the minimum wage have income dips that suggest taking unpaid time off work. Yet, only half of them were eligible for two weeks of parental leave. This presentation discusses certain aspects of fathers’ life around the birth.
