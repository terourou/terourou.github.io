Common occupational exposures have been associated with IHD, but evidence is conflicting. For the whole NZ adult working population at the time of the 2013 census, data were extracted from the Statistics NZ IDI, on occupation and incident IHD from 2013 to 2018. The number of working hours was extracted from the census, and exposure to sedentary work, loud noise, and night shift was assessed through NZ job exposure matrices. This study suggests occupational exposure to high levels of noise and night shifts increase IHD risk while there was no evidence of association with sedentary work and long working hours.
