This study investigated whether coverage of extreme family violence in New Zealand media is biased across a range of key factors gender, ethnicity, and age of victims, as well as the victimâ€™s relationship to the killer. Our results were derived from a cohort of 946 articles published online by New Zealand media outlets. Analyzing the number of media articles relating to victims from each group (exposure) and their online presence (prominence), we found that although media coverage is generally quite equitable, certain groups of victims are severely under-represented - particularly true for victims from Pacifica communities and elderly victims.
