Microsimulation models such as the New Zealand Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) model play an important role in estimating the impacts of potential policy changes. A challenge facing these models is in estimating the take up of programmes like the Accommodation Supplement (AS). This can lead to significant uncertainty in estimated outcomes, such as fiscal costs and reductions in child poverty. In this presentation the Treasury’s TAWA team outlines work undertaken to better model AS by using administrative data on this programme contained in Stats NZ’s Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).
