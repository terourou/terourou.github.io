As the complexity of a model increases, so does the uncertainty inherent in the model’s output. I consider Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques to assess the reliability of a complex network contagion model we have developed for informing Aotearoa New Zealand’s COVID-19 response. By fitting Gaussian process surrogate models to output from the network contagion model, we can quickly and efficiently apply UQ methods and perform inference on model parameters.  Using New Zealand COVID-19 case number data, we can also condition these surrogates to make predictions without having to rerun the computationally expensive network contagion model.
