If your data consists of tables rather than individual records, and if one of your variables is age, then you are doing applied demography. Bayesian statistical methods help you do applied demography better. Bayesian methods are particularly helpful if your data is disaggregated, or if you are forecasting. The technical barriers to doing Bayesian demography can, however, be daunting. The talk describes a long-term project to develop methods and tools that reduce these barriers.
