The potentially fatal or severe consequences of many injuries can be reduced through an optimally structured prehospital trauma system that can provide timely and appropriate care. This retrospective cohort study linked data from St John and Wellington Free Ambulances, the NZ Trauma Registry, Ministry of Health (Mortality, Hospital discharge and NHI) and Coronial post-mortem reports. The projectâ€™s aim is to help identify opportunities to optimise the delivery of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) care in NZ. The collaborative multidisciplinary team includes researchers from St John, Universities of Auckland and Otago. More details about this project are in our protocol paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33514568/.
