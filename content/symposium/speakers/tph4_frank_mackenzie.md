FluTracking is an online participatory surveillance system that has been used for collecting data on influenza seasons in Australia and New Zealand, wherein participants fill out a weekly survey on whether they have experienced symptoms. This has several advantages over sentinel-based data collection, allowing for near real-time reporting of symptoms and mitigating some bias. This study analyses New Zealand FluTracking data from April 2020 to April 2021, examining the impact of various factors on the incidence of flu- and COVID-like symptoms. I will discuss the various ways bias is introduced into these data, the methods employed to mitigate bias, and the potential of systems like FluTracking for public health surveillance.
