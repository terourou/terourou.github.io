Analytics on population movement has become increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, Data Ventures partnered with Vodafone and Spark to produce aggregated device counts at an hourly level for small geographies. We then developed a novel weighting methodology to create population estimates, broken down based on whether they are local to an area, domestic visitors, or international visitors. Our daily data provided insight into high mobility areas during lockdown. We now continue to use the data to inform the post COVID-19 recovery of international and domestic tourism.
