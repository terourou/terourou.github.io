The Innovations in Applied Data Symposium is less than a week away! A big thank you to those who have already submitted their presentation slides to me - if you're still working on it, please have this done by Monday (1 June) at the latest so we can have everything ready for the technicians at Te Papa.

Remember, your presentation needs to be
- 5 minutes maximum (we have a lot of talks to get through)
- 4 slides total
- in 16 x 9 aspect ratio (if it's in PowerPoint)
- showing contact details for getting more information about your work on your final slide (slide 4).

The event programme is now available on our website, https://terourou.org/symposium, where you can look through the individual streams to find when your talk will be. Each talk is allocated 8 minutes: 5 minutes to speak, and 3 to answer a question or two and hand over to the next speaker. We have a total of 57 talks in three streams, plus 3 keynotes and a panel discussion, and about 180 in-person registrations, so it's going to be a great if busy day!

Talks will be recorded for the live stream and made available online afterwards, so if you can't make it to a particular talk on the day, you can catch up over the weekend. We intend to make presentations available on the event app (you'll receive details on this later) and our website, so anyone who cannot attend the symposium will be able to look and see what amazing things are being done with data in Aotearoa.

**Please let me know ASAP if you do not want your presentation hosted on a public platform**.

If you'd like us to display your email address with your abstract and presentation on our website so people can contact you, let me know.

If you have any enquiries, don't hesitate to get in touch with me. However, on Wednesday, 2 June, I'll be unavailable for most of the day: if your query is urgent, please CC our event organiser Nicky Remkes <nicky@tomdickandharry.org.nz> who will be available to help until 2 pm.

We look forward to seeing you at Te Papa on Thursday!

Ngā mihi nui,

Tom
