This work looks at how advanced information search software can improve how doctors and nurses find what they need to know from patient electronic records. It is hoped that clinicians can find patient specific information faster, and more comprehensively and accurately. While electronic patient records can keep information in one physical area, this does not necessarily make it easier to find specific information. This is especially so for patients with complicated illnesses, or illnesses that affect many different organs at once. With Smart search clinicians should be more confident that they have found all the information needed for patient care.
