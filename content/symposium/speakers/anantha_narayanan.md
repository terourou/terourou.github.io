Wellbeing measures currently available in New Zealand are not sensitive enough to capture the effects of policy change – this is partly due to the lack of detailed population-level wellbeing data. Microdata within NZ’s IDI promises to provide a better understanding of wellbeing; however, detailed measures of wellbeing (from the General Social Survey) are only available for a smaller subset of IDI records (i.e., ~8,500 individuals). Extrapolating these wellbeing data to the full IDI population may be possible via advanced data modelling. In this research, we aim to apply machine learning techniques that can predict wellbeing outcomes from IDI administrative data.
