The Social Wellbeing Agency worked in partnership with Tokona Te Raki, a Ngāi Tahu-led collaborative established to increase Māori participation, success and progression in education and employment outcomes. Our research focuses on data discovery to learn actionable insights that identify the most important barriers, levers, and boosters that help young Māori to succeed. The research builds on the existing evidence base investigating the need for better transition pathways for Māori aged 15-29 years. Mixed methods were applied to answer the research question. We conducted the quantitative analysis in New Zealand's Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).
