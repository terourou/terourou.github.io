Epidemix^[Muellner U, Fournie G, Muellner P, Ahlstrom C, Pfeiffer D. epidemix - an Interactive Multi-Model Application for Teaching and Visualizing Infectious Disease Transmission. Epidemics, doi: 10.1016/j.epidem.2017.12.003, 2017.] allows users to develop an understanding of the impact of disease modelling assumptions on the trajectory of an epidemic and the impact of control interventions, without having to directly deal with the complexity of equations and programming languages. The app provides a visual interface for nine generic models, plus two disease-specific models of international relevance (COVID-19 and ASF). Epidemix supports the teaching of mathematical modelling to non-specialists – including policy makers by demonstrating key concepts of disease dynamics and control in a hands-on way.  Funded by the Royal Veterinary College and the City University of Hong Kong (www.epidemix.app).
