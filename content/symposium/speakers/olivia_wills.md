Over half a million New Zealanders owe fines to the Ministry of Justice, and total collections debt is around US$395m, or US$78 for every person in New Zealand. There are consequences for people who do not pay, as they can be hit with enforcement actions or may be summoned to Court. We used evidence from behavioural science to test new approaches to improve fines payment behaviour, using letters and text message reminders. Our results demonstrate that small tweaks to existing processes can be effective at changing behaviour, and pave the way for the future application of behavioural science in the fines collection space.
