 Population definitions are well established into our mahi at Stats NZ. However, when Data Ventures reached out to our tourism customers, we identified a key disconnect between expected definitions of visitors and actual definitions. Specifically, our customers thought of visitors as tourists and needed these numbers to inform their COVID-19 response. We developed a new measure of visitors, named ‘short-term visitors’, that predominantly represents tourists and was validated against visa and migration data. We present a comparison between visitor definitions and discuss how these definitions may differ in value based on the context and customer expectation.
