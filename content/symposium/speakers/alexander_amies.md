Land cover mapping is important for national- and regional-scale policy decision making, and environment and biodiversity monitoring. Previous time steps of Manaaki Whenua’s Land Cover Database (LCDB) have leveraged expert analysis of large volumes of multi-temporal satellite imagery to identify areas of change. This approach traditionally relies on rule-based decision systems in conjunction with time consuming manual data cleaning. We explore the potential of artificial intelligence for developing more flexible, automated processes for land cover classification and change detection. We compare machine learning and object-based methods with image-based convolutional encoder-decoders enabling more fine-grained spatial and temporal predictions.
