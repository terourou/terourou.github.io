Real-time health intelligence is essential to an effective public health response. The NZ COVID-19 dashboards were built with this need in mind drawing on ESR’s EpiSurv database for notifiable diseases. Once published, the dashboards and underlying data streams had to evolve as the response progressed e.g. to differentiate between cases occurring in the community and MIQ or to provide insight into identified outbreaks. Using a R Shiny framework allowed us to dynamically adjust the dashboards to response requirements, which was critical. The COVID-19 dashboards were built for the Ministry of Health in collaboration with ESR. Public dashboard available at: https://nzcoviddashboard.esr.cri.nz/.
