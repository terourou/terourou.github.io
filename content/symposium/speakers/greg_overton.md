The Household Energy End-Use Project #2 (HEEP2) is collecting data on how, and why, energy is used in households across New Zealand.  From July 2021, HEEP2 will be recruiting 280 households from the Stats NZ Household Economic Survey. These households will each be monitored over 12 months, using a range of instrumentation and surveys, with the final up-to-date picture of energy use being available in the Stats NZ Data Lab. The HEEP2 data will allow researchers to answer a whole raft of questions, with the aim of understanding how to enable and motivate people to affordably create healthy home environments, in ways that contribute to a low-emissions economy.
