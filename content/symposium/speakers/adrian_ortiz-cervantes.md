In this work we analyze the employee mobility in New Zealand and its repercussions on knowledge and skills transfer amongst different industries, in the context of in temporal complex networks.  Using tax records from all the employees and firms in New Zealand from the year 2000 to 2017, we created a bipartite temporal network of employers and employees that allow us to implement a model for the transfer of tacit knowledge between employees, and estimate the stock of knowledge inside firms and sectors across different skills.
