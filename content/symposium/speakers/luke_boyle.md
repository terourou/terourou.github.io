DAOH scores can be an effective way to measure health outcomes by collapsing many negative outcomes after surgery, such as death or readmission, into one number. This study used routine data from the Ministry of Health and applied novel risk adjustment methods to illustrate how DAOH scores can detect differences between patients, different types of operations and DHBs in NZ.

Using this data, we can identify important areas of difference, for example between hospitals, that can be further audited to improve outcomes after surgery or to investigate optimal patient pathways for recovery.
