Minnesota in the United States is well known for its beautiful “10,000 lakes” - however the complex system of waterbodies is threatened by the spread of aquatic invasive species. We developed the AIS Explorer in collaboration with the Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center of the University of Minnesota to bridge research and decision making, for example to optimise watercraft inspections.

In this talk we will showcase how a diverse set of technologies, like R, R Shiny, Python and cloud computing was integrated to a create a tool that is easy to use and matches stakeholder needs.
