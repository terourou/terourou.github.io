Trees and forests have major impacts on planetary and human wellbeing.  In an increasingly urbanised world, urban trees and forests become important for human wellbeing. Many studies show the benefits of urban trees and forests – health, climate change, urban planning and ecological perspectives. Using a wellbeing framework, quantitative data from remote sensing, modelling and social and cultural administrative data, we aim to understand the impact of urban trees across a range of wellbeing domains. Using epidemiological methods, we aim to discover correlations and patterns between urban trees and human wellbeing in Singapore and Wellington. More information?
