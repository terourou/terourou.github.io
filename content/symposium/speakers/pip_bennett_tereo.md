He Ara Poutama mō te Reo Māori is a project that focuses on forecasting levels of te Reo Māori acquisition into the future including consideration of the impacts of changing language revitalisation initiatives. We are working with subject matter experts and organisations to help ensure this taonga is accessible for present and future generations. Nicholson Consulting is a data science consultancy in Te Whanagnui-a-Tara; we are partnering with Kōtātā Insights to use quantitative methods to assist our clients on their haerenga to see Māori as a living language and as an ordinary means of communication.
