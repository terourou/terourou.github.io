This descriptive study uses education and taxation data to analyse patterns in employment for tertiary students in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using the Integrated Data Infrastructure to link tax data and tertiary enrolment data, and the Household Labour Force Survey to estimate hourly rates, we observe a strong seasonal pattern in employment rate and hours worked for full-time students, and to a lesser extent, part-time students.  We also find key differences between international and domestic students. This work can give universities better insight into a key part of studentsâ€™ lives, which has until now only been understood from surveys and anecdotes.
