Timeline are sequences of events and periods which reflect significant parts of a person’s experience. They can be an effective tool for researchers seeking to understand life events, and interactions between events, over time.

To share timeline information while respecting privacy and confidentiality, we have developed a representative timeline methodology. This method produces a timeline that captures experiences that are common across a group of people — similar to a group average.

This presentation will demonstrate the technique, drawing examples from our first application of it – a study of South Auckland families’ experiences around the birth of a child.
