A large proportion of victimisation in New Zealand is unreported. Because of this, the Ministry of Justice has commissioned a series of surveys to understand the nature and prevalence of unreported victimisation. By linking this survey data to administrative datasets in the IDI it is possible to understand government service use for victims who do not necessarily report to the Police.
