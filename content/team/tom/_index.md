Tom completed his PhD in Statistics at the University of Auckland in 2020, which explored ways of improving the reliability of real-time bus arrival time prediction in Auckland by accounting for real-time traffic conditions. Since 2015, he has been the lead developer of iNZight, a free, easy-to-use data analysis and visualisation tool for statistics learners. Both the research and iNZight combine his two passions: computing and making tools to help others make sense of the world. Tom is now redirecting these skills towards social and health data, in particular exploring ways of improving access to and application of these invaluable datasets.
