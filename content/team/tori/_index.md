Tori's summer work included gaining in-depth knowledge of the Te Kupenga surveys by StatsNZ and developing statistical and programming skills applicable for use in the IDI. Additionally, it was of interest to understand the administrative processes of beginning research to build a foundation of knowledge to carry into future postgraduate studies.
