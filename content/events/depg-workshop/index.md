An information-sharing event and workshop to discuss what the New Zealand data system could look like.

Key themes discussed:

* What are the biggest present challenges with the current data system?
* MƒÅori data access and governance
* What would an optimal holistic ethics process look like?
* Example priority areas:
    * Equality of access
    * Standard linkages of popular datasets
    * Externalising data catalogues
    * Definitive code repositories
    * Optimal (effective, timely, standardised) governance processes

The aim of this workshop was to establish the key themes for a Symposium to be held in early 2023. A summary report of the event is below.
