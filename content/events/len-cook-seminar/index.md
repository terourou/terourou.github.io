A long-standing trust in public services is being challenged for a mix of reasons. This has brought to light a variety of long-standing tensions that exist in the scope, development, evaluation and publication of evidence about public services in New Zealand. These include:

* A mantra of evidence-based policy which overshadows the critical importance of evidence-based process and practice.
* The nature of risks from relying on anecdote and rare events to influence policy change and practice that the paring back of evidence in the public domain helps create.
* A focus on institutional measures ignores the changing societal context and dynamics of population groups that is essential to assess generational change in wellbeing.
* Ignorance of the judicial and societal dimensions of proportionality.
* The role of independent well-resourced third parties (Ombudsman, Judiciary, Auditor-General) for providing public confidence in trustworthiness of public services.
* The importance of evidence from social sciences, official statistics, operational research and continuous improvement in enabling sector change involving diverse autonomous agencies.
* The necessity for of government wide principles that provide common assurance of the integrity of research selection, methods, quality and release.

The presentation will extent the evidence framework developed by Superu by drawing on an analysis of the five reviews of Oranga Tamariki, as well as experiences in official statistics. It will include examples from the presenter’s study of the justice system.
