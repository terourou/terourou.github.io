### Bio

Dr. C. Matthew Snipp (Oklahoma Cherokee and Choctaw) is the Burnet C. and Mildred Finley Wohlford Professor of Humanities and Sciences in the Department of Sociology. He also serves as the Vice Provost for Faculty Development, Diversity and Engagement. As a demographer and the author of numerous articles and books, his scholarship deals with the methodology of racial measurement, changes in the social and economic well-being of American ethnic minorities, and American Indian demography. He has extensively studied the racial and ethnic composition of the United States, and has focused much of his attention on the Native American population in the United States and indigenous populations in other parts of the world. He recently has been engaged in two projects evaluating the quality of the 2020 census; one sponsored by the American Statistical Association and another under the auspices of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. In his role as a Vice Provost, his office is responsible for a variety of programs designed to support the Stanford faculty individually and collectively in their research and teaching, as well as efforts to advance faculty diversity at the University.
