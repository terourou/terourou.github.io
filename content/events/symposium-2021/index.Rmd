Weâ€™ll soon circulate an open invitation to submit abstracts for quickfire presentations of 5 minutes, grouped by themes and data types. There will also be keynote speakers and a plenary session to summarise the key issues raised during the day.

The symposium is open to anybody working in the collection, management, analysis or access to applied data, from government, non-government and academic environments.

The event will be free to attend and catering will be provided, but registration will be required.
