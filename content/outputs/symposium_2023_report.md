In March 2023, the Informatics for Social Services and Wellbeing Programme, Te Rourou Tātaritanga, and the Social Wellbeing Agency hosted a two-day symposium in Wellington on New Zealand’s data assets. Recognising the world-leading status of New Zealand’s public data, the symposium brought together national and international data providers, users, experts, and authorities to discuss how the value of the data system can be fully realised and built upon.

The symposium was opened by the Minister for Statistics Hon Deborah Russell. Across two days, world leading international experts in big data infrastructure, analytics, ethics and privacy, presented on a wide range of topics, including keynote speakers Professor Julia Lane (New York University, Cofounder Coleridge Initiative) and Dr Nancy Potok (Director Data Foundation, Former Chief Statistician of the USA). Full speaker biographies and presentation slides are available at https://terourou.org/symposium2023/speakers/. Over 150 attendees reflected a broad range of groups involved with New Zealand’s data systems, including government agencies, NGOs, data practitioners and academic institutions, alongside the invited international speakers.
