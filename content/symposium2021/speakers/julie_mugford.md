The Ministry of Transport is developing an agent based model of the NZ transport system. The model builds a representation of the entire transport system as the sum of millions of different interactions as everyone seeks to achieve their own sets of goals and ambitions. We aim to offer better insights into complex systems by aggregating the interactions of individual agents (people) as they attempt to complete activities. Through their interactions with a transport network and each other, we get a more realistic representation of how individual travel choices impact the system.
