*Houston We Have* uses proprietary software, data, technology and mathematics to help humans make better decisions, especially when most at risk. Sectors where we already develop predictions, forecasts and risk models for enhanced strategic and operational decision making include defence, financial services and fintech, natural resources, and health. Our software, technology and data insight capability can be deployed in any area where better quality, visibility and traceability around decision making is important.
