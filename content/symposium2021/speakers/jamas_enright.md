Economic conditions evolve very quickly during crisis periods, and we (the New Zealand government) needed a timely and high-frequency measure of economic conditions to inform policy-making. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is released quarterly and 10 weeks after the reference quarter. The New Zealand Activity Index (NZAC) was developed by combining eight source indicators and uses principal component analysis to capture as much co-movement of these indicators as possible. This measure is monthly and comes out 2-3 weeks after the end of the month. While not as comprehensive as GDP the NZAC provides a good leading indicator for monthly economic activity.
