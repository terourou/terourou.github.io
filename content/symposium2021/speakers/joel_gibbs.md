There are a number of data sources and research methods that can be used to understand how households change over time. This project used Social Housing Register data collated via the Integrated Data Infrastructure to analyse the housing pathways of individuals and households who require public housing, and sought out to understand the likelihood that an individual or household that leaves the Housing Register will re-enter the Housing Register in the future. For individuals that re-enter the Housing Register, this research also looked at how households tend to change between applications.
