In New Zealand (NZ) three in ten 2-14 year- olds are affected by overweight/obesity with ethnic disparities. The existing data used to monitor growth of 0-19-year-olds are fragmented and mostly aggregated at the national level. Thus, NZ lacks group-specific information on prevalence, trends, and determinants of healthy growth for this group, crucial information if equitable improvements are to be achieved. We will map and assess diverse national sources of anthropometric data of 0-19-year-olds (last 2 decades) to establish what would be required and which sources would be suitable to be included in a national monitoring platform.
