In this study we constructed a low-level spatial index of public transport (PT) supply across the 25,000 meshblocks in the Auckland, Canterbury and Greater Wellington regions. Using Open Route planner and Google Transit Feed data, for each meshblock in the study area we calculated the walking distance to the nearest PT location, the number of accessible locations (per capita), the number of accessible routes and (peak-time) services and the transit time from place of residence to place of work via PT networks. These metrics were then combined into an overall PT Supply Score. The results of this study are visualised in an interactive Power BI dashboard.
