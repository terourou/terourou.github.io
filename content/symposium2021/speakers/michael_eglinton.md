Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) is the Treasury’s microsimulation model of the New Zealand personal tax and transfer system. The TAWA model uses a combination of survey and administrative data within Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure to model potential policy changes. It is used extensively within Treasury and in external work related to policy analysis of tax and welfare settings.
