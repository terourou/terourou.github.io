Despite the complexity of modern socio-economic systems, current benchmark models assume the economy is much simpler than it really is: households are often assumed to be identical, and firms are assumed to use the same equipment to produce the same "representative" product.

Recent developments in Agent-Based Modelling have provided an alternative to conventional models. Such models show comparable forecasting performance despite being a relatively early stage of development.

This presentation will discuss ABM modelling and the use of microdata from the New Zealand IDI to calibrate these models.
