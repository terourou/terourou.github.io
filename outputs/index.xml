      <title>The Impact of Synthetic Data Generation Techniques in IDI Research</title>
      <link>https://terourou.org/outputs/impacts-of-synthetic-data/</link>

      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/impacts-of-synthetic-data/</guid>
      <description>Synthetic data is a versatile tool. When used correctly, it is compliant with data confidentiality principles, rules and methods set out by Statistics NZ. We believe synthetic data in general may have the risk of single out an individual in the dataset with extreme value and linkage attack with more than one dataset. In order to mitigate these risks, we will follow NZ Stats release guidance and expertise from the NZ Stats release team.</description>

      <title>IDI Search App</title>

      <description>The IDI Search App allows researchers to explore what variables are available in the IDI, and provides descriptions and SQL information about each variable. The app uses Data Dictionaries from Statistics NZ to collate collection, dataset, and variable information, which is stored within a relational database. The front end is powered by NextJS, allowing us to provide an interface for users to list all variables or, more usefully, those variables, datasets, and collections that match a specific search term.</description>

      <title>iNZight: A GUI for Data Visualisation and Analysis through R</title>
      <link>https://terourou.org/outputs/inzight-jss/</link>

      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/inzight-jss/</guid>
      <description>Visualisation, exploration, and analysis of data is often inaccessible to many due to high up-front costs of learning the necessary coding skills to get started. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have often been used to provide inexperienced users with access to these underlying, complex systems without the need for coding. R GUIs are available, but they require some degree of experience with R and a familiarity with statistical concepts. iNZight is a GUI-based tool written in R that enables both students and researchers to interact with and explore data without the need for code.</description>

      <title>Digitizing Birth Records for Intergenerational Research</title>
      <link>https://terourou.org/outputs/digitizing-birth-records-for-intergenerational-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:55:33 +1300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/digitizing-birth-records-for-intergenerational-research/</guid>
      <description>Intergenerational links are important to assess intergenerational transfer of wealth, intergenerational socio-economic mobility, and familial influences on health and wellbeing. Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) birth records in the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) can be used for intergenerational research, but currently these records are only available from 1985 onwards, which limits the ability to investigate multigenerational links. Digitization of earlier records back to 1972 (when full dates of birth - a necessary linking variable - were first recorded) would enable a greater exploration of multigenerational links for the full population of New Zealand births over a 50 year period.</description>

      <title>iNZight 4.1: Big updates for survey handling</title>

      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/inzight_4.1/</guid>
      <description>The latest release features a major overhaul of iNZight&amp;rsquo;s handling of survey designs, as well as several other significant user interface changes. Our focus has been on making iNZight a development tool for researchers to use on a wide range of data, specifically from survey designs, in a way that minimises specialist skills (such as understanding the underlying structure of the survey).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Demography with iNZight</title>
      <link>https://terourou.org/outputs/inzight_demography/</link>

      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/inzight_demography/</guid>
      <description>Bayesian demography is an important technique for minority communites, and requires special methods to infer the correct results. A set of existing R packages provide a way for researchers to fit hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate birth rates, life expectancy, or forecast important values such as diabetes rates.
iNZight is a tool for exploring and analysing data, and provides a way for researchers low on time, money, and/or skill to quickly generate the necessary results with minimal effort.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s in the IDI?</title>

      <description>The IDI Search App allows researchers to explore what variables are available in the IDI, and provides descriptions and SQL information about each variable. This build is a prototype of the types of features we would like, and worked as a proof-of-concept before buildling a more fully-featured and user friendly version.

      <guid>https://terourou.org/outputs/intergenerational-analyses-using-the-idi/</guid>
      <description>This report documents the potential for intergenerational links in the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). Three questions are answered:
 How many people can be linked back one, two, and three generations? How does this vary by decade of birth? How does this vary by ethnicity and deprivation?  </description>
