				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Data preparation is a key stage for analytic and research projects. However, as the number of data sources increases so does the complexity of preparation. Without a consistent method for assembling analysis-ready datasets, this process can become time-consuming, expensive, and error prone.</p>
<p>In response to this, we have developed the Dataset Assembly Tool. By standardising and automating the data preparation and dataset assembly stages of analytic projects, the tool helps staff deliver higher quality work faster. The assembly tool is now available for other researchers to use. This presentation with describe the tool and its advantages.</p>

					Adopting an improvement science approach to inform ongoing implementation of the Mana Ake initiative in Canterbury
				</h5>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
					Speaker: <strong>Caralyn Purvis</strong>
				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Recognising the value of data and analytics saw the integration of an improvement science approach to inform service-delivery, within a cross-sector mental health initiative &mdash; Mana Ake. An increased prevalence of wellbeing concerns resulted in a holistic, locally-informed, collaborative initiative for tamariki. Internal review of mixed-methods data has allowed for a truly data-informed iterative approach to service improvement. Consequently, evaluation has influenced the responsiveness of the initiative to optimally meet the needs of the communities it supports. A collaborative initiative between health, education, and wider communities. Evaluation domains include: tamariki, whānau, schools/kura, communities, system.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>There are a number of data sources and research methods that can be used to understand how households change over time. This project used Social Housing Register data collated via the Integrated Data Infrastructure to analyse the housing pathways of individuals and households who require public housing, and sought out to understand the likelihood that an individual or household that leaves the Housing Register will re-enter the Housing Register in the future. For individuals that re-enter the Housing Register, this research also looked at how households tend to change between applications.</p>

					Application of data science methodologies to explore, predict, and model wellbeing outcomes using the New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).
				</h5>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
					Speaker: <strong>
Anantha Narayanan, Tom Stewart, and Scott Duncan
</strong>
				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Wellbeing measures currently available in New Zealand are not sensitive enough to capture the effects of policy change – this is partly due to the lack of detailed population-level wellbeing data. Microdata within NZ’s IDI promises to provide a better understanding of wellbeing; however, detailed measures of wellbeing (from the General Social Survey) are only available for a smaller subset of IDI records (i.e., ~8,500 individuals). Extrapolating these wellbeing data to the full IDI population may be possible via advanced data modelling. In this research, we aim to apply machine learning techniques that can predict wellbeing outcomes from IDI administrative data.</p>

				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Associations between IHD and occupations are poorly understood. This whole-population study aimed to identify occupations associated with increased IHD risk in NZ by sex and ethnicity. A cohort of workers was constructed for the whole NZ adult working population using the Statistics NZ IDI. Occupation was obtained from census data and incident IHD was determined using hospitalisation, prescription, and death records from 2013 to 2018. This study confirmed an increased IHD risk for several occupations previously identified as being high risk for IHD and has also identified some potentially new occupational groups. Important sex and ethnic differences were also observed.</p>

				<h5>
					Automating national land cover mapping using artificial intelligence
				</h5>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
					Speaker: <strong>
Alexander Amies and Jan Schindler
</strong>
				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Land cover mapping is important for national- and regional-scale policy decision making, and environment and biodiversity monitoring. Previous time steps of Manaaki Whenua’s Land Cover Database (LCDB) have leveraged expert analysis of large volumes of multi-temporal satellite imagery to identify areas of change. This approach traditionally relies on rule-based decision systems in conjunction with time consuming manual data cleaning. We explore the potential of artificial intelligence for developing more flexible, automated processes for land cover classification and change detection. We compare machine learning and object-based methods with image-based convolutional encoder-decoders enabling more fine-grained spatial and temporal predictions.</p>

					Bayesian Demography
				</h5>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
					Speaker: <strong>John Bryant</strong>
				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>If your data consists of tables rather than individual records, and if one of your variables is age, then you are doing applied demography. Bayesian statistical methods help you do applied demography better. Bayesian methods are particularly helpful if your data is disaggregated, or if you are forecasting. The technical barriers to doing Bayesian demography can, however, be daunting. The talk describes a long-term project to develop methods and tools that reduce these barriers.</p>

					Calibrating Economic Agent-Based Models with Microdata
				</h5>
				<div style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">
					Speaker: <strong>Will Scarrold</strong>
				</div>

				
				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Despite the complexity of modern socio-economic systems, current benchmark models assume the economy is much simpler than it really is: households are often assumed to be identical, and firms are assumed to use the same equipment to produce the same &ldquo;representative&rdquo; product.</p>
<p>Recent developments in Agent-Based Modelling have provided an alternative to conventional models. Such models show comparable forecasting performance despite being a relatively early stage of development.</p>
<p>This presentation will discuss ABM modelling and the use of microdata from the New Zealand IDI to calibrate these models.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>In this study we constructed a low-level spatial index of public transport (PT) supply across the 25,000 meshblocks in the Auckland, Canterbury and Greater Wellington regions. Using Open Route planner and Google Transit Feed data, for each meshblock in the study area we calculated the walking distance to the nearest PT location, the number of accessible locations (per capita), the number of accessible routes and (peak-time) services and the transit time from place of residence to place of work via PT networks. These metrics were then combined into an overall PT Supply Score. The results of this study are visualised in an interactive Power BI dashboard.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Illnesses and deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic have not been evenly distributed across communities. Risk factors for serious disease (including age, ethnicity, &amp; health conditions), and risk factors for infection (including dwelling size, inter-generational living, &amp; type of work) are not independent. In order to capture the interactions between these factors we build on data from linked StatisticsNZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) to construct a network of the ~5million individuals and their interaction contexts, in particular homes, workplaces, and schools. I will highlight our progress so far, and priorities for future refinements.</p>

					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Comparing population health outcomes for different places, population groups or time periods is complicated by access to data, different population sizes and population age structures. There are robust epidemiological methods for doing these calculations, but they are not always straightforward, especially when depicting the precision estimates in the results. Mātau is a tool that embeds various robust epidemiological methods, population data and imports outcome data to create a point and click way to calculate levels of health outcomes and compare populations. Already in use in Aotearoa and overseas, it is quick, easy to learn and all results in table and graph format.</p>

					Exploratory Drivers of Transition as Applied on Workforce Modelling

				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>Describing factors affecting individuals’ transitions addresses several policy questions. For instance, differentiating retention and exit rates of groups of the workforce based on geography, demography or intervention may inform decision-makers in formulating more targeted policies that can influence funding and the lives of people. We tried developing a framework analysing the drivers of transition in the IDI and employed transition modelling to answer these questions aimed at replicating this to several aspects of people’s lives, such as labour force, education and health. We also employed classification models to address some of limitations, like imputing occupation.</p>

				<details>
					<summary>Read abstract</summary>
					<p><p>This study investigated whether coverage of extreme family violence in New Zealand media is biased across a range of key factors gender, ethnicity, and age of victims, as well as the victim’s relationship to the killer. Our results were derived from a cohort of 946 articles published online by New Zealand media outlets. Analyzing the number of media articles relating to victims from each group (exposure) and their online presence (prominence), we found that although media coverage is generally quite equitable, certain groups of victims are severely under-represented - particularly true for victims from Pacifica communities and elderly victims.</p>

Thus, NZ lacks group-specific information on prevalence, trends, and determinants of healthy growth for this group, crucial information if equitable improvements are to be achieved. We will map and assess diverse national sources of anthropometric data of 0-19-year-olds (last 2 decades) to establish what would be required and which sources would be suitable to be included in a national monitoring platform.

Manual tasks like downloading data from email, updating new data file names in scripts, running scripts in sequence and more, can be managed with Python and its rich ecosystem of packages.

We present a comparison between visitor definitions and discuss how these definitions may differ in value based on the context and customer expectation.</p>

					<p><p>This descriptive study uses education and taxation data to analyse patterns in employment for tertiary students in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using the Integrated Data Infrastructure to link tax data and tertiary enrolment data, and the Household Labour Force Survey to estimate hourly rates, we observe a strong seasonal pattern in employment rate and hours worked for full-time students, and to a lesser extent, part-time students.  We also find key differences between international and domestic students. This work can give universities better insight into a key part of students’ lives, which has until now only been understood from surveys and anecdotes.
