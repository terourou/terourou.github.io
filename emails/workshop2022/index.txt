Data Ethics, Privacy, and Governance Workshop
4 April 2022 | 9am - 12pm | Zoom

Kia ora koutou,

Please join us on April 4th, 2022, for an information sharing event and workshop to discuss what the New Zealand data system could look like. This will be held online.
Key themes to be discussed:

- What are the biggest present challenges with the current data system?
- Māori data access and governance
- What would an optimal holistic ethics process look like?
- Example priority areas:
    - Equality of access
    - Standard linkages of popular datasets
    - Externalising data catalogues
    - Definitive code repositories
    - Optimal (effective, timely, standardised) governance processes

The aim for this workshop is to establish the key themes for a Symposium to be held October 2022.
